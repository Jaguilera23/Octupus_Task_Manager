# Task Manager

This is the final project I completed for the JavaScript course at [CoderHouse](https://www.coderhouse.es/?utm_term=coderhouse&utm_campaign=0&utm_source=google_search_brand&utm_medium=cpc&gclid=Cj0KCQjw8qmhBhClARIsANAtbofTiZZCHzIytoPyUPvCFmzL2ODsF1gAwTUmOu1itlChMJlrZy3MPzIaAhnTEALw_wcB). t is a web application for a task manager that includes login, user registration, password recovery, and a dashboard.

## Features

This project represents a web application that simulates a task manager, providing users with the ability to create, edit, and delete tasks, as well as classify them based on their status. Additionally, users can assign a responsible person to each task. The user interface includes a dashboard that displays informative cards for each created task. With this application, users can effectively track their tasks and manage them in an organized manner.

## Technologies

To develop this project, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used, along with Sass and Bootstrap to enhance the efficiency of the development process. Sass allowed for more efficient and modular styling, while Bootstrap facilitated the creation of a responsive and high-quality design.
